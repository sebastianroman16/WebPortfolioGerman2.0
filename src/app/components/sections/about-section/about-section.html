      I am from Santiago, Chile. I attended a high school that specialized in electricity as a
      trade, so when I graduated, I also became a certified electrician. In my final year, I
      completed an internship, which led to my first job.
    </p>
    <p>
      After high school, I pursued a degree in automation and industrial control, graduating in
      2013 as the valedictorian of my program. I then worked in the electrical field for five years
      across various factories and companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2015, I decided to continue my education and began studying electrical engineering while
      finding a job that accommodated my new schedule. That same year, I got married and started the
      process of becoming a U.S. resident.
    </p>
    <p>
      I received my residency before completing my engineering degree, so I decided to move to the
      U.S. in 2017. In 2018, while working, I studied to obtain my HVAC license and later secured a
      job as an HVAC technician.
    </p>
    <p>
      After completing the HVAC program, I was offered a position as an instructor at the same
      professional technician school I attended due to my advanced knowledge of electricity. I
      worked there for two years, teaching the basics of electricity and HVAC.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked as an HVAC technician for four years and decided to return to school in 2021 to
      pursue an Associate of Arts degree. In 2022, I became a full-time student, and in 2023, I
      graduated.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2024, I transferred to the University of South Florida (USF), where I am currently
      completing my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.
