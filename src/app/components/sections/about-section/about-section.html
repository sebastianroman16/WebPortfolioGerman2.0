      I am an Electrical Engineering student with extensive hands-on experience in electrical
      systems, automation, and industrial control. I began my technical training in Santiago,
      Chile, where I attended a trade-focused high school specializing in electricity and became a
      certified electrician, completing an internship that led to my first professional role.

      I later earned an associate's degree in Automation and Industrial Control, graduating as
      valedictorian, and worked for several years in industrial and factory environments performing
      electrical installation, troubleshooting, and control-related tasks. After relocating to the
      United States, I continued working in the electrical field while further expanding my
      technical scope by completing an HVAC program, earning both a diploma and professional
      license, and working as an HVAC technician. I was later offered an instructor position at a
      professional technical school, where I taught electrical and HVAC fundamentals.

      I am currently a Student Assistant at the University of South Florida, where I support the
      Automation and Controls Laboratory and assist with laboratory-based courses. I was selected
      for this role after successfully completing a research project in which I built, commissioned,
      and brought into operation the first delta robot at USF (Omron Quattro 650HS).

      I am completing my Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of South
      Florida, with an expected graduation date of December 2026. My academic and professional
      interests include control systems, power systems, power electronics, robotics, and industrial
      automation, and I bring a strong combination of practical field experience and formal
      engineering education.
